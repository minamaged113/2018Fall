    "**Objective**\n",
    "This exercise aims to give you an initial illustration on python programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Running Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open \"Anaconda Prompt\"\n",
    "    * \"Start\" -> \"Anaconda Prompt\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Run Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "    * using following command to run the Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    jupyter notebook --notebook-dir='yourNotebookDir'\n",
    "    ```, **yourNotebookDir** is the directory where you want ot implement your experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Environment setting up and debuging\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. IDE\n",
    "You are also encouraged to using IDE during the development of your exercise, since the Jupyter Notebook may not friendly for debugging. So here we suggest two IDEs for you to debug your program:\n",
    "* Eclipse with pydev addons ([`pydev installation guide`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZO0-AOSLwA))\n",
    "* PyCharm \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Install packages \n",
    "During this course, you may need 3rd party packages which you may need to install by yourself, especially when you are using  your own computers. Below are some hints to install external packages (all commands are typed in the anaconda prompt):\n",
    "* ```pip install PACKAGE_NAME``` for python 2, ```pip3 install PACKAGE_NAME``` for python 3\n",
    "* If you do not have the root permission, you may use ```pip install PACKAGE_NAME --user``` to install package in your home folder.\n",
    "* If you want a package with specific version, you may use ```pip3 install PACKAGE_NAME==VERSION_CODE```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Import packages in your code\n",
    "* Import a package using ```import packageName```, then you can call function provided by the package by ```packageName.functionName()```\n",
    "  * EXAMPLE:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      import numpy\n",
    "      myEmptyArray = numpy.zeros([nRow, cCol], dtype=float)\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "* Import a package and give it another alias by ```import packageName as alias```, then you can use the alias to represent the package in your later code.\n",
    "  * EXAMPLE:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      import numpy as np\n",
    "      myEmptyArray = np.zeros([nRow, cCol], dtype=float)\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "* Directly import a function from a package by ```from packageName import functionName```, then you can directly call the function in your later code.\n",
    "  * EXAMPLE:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      from numpy import zeros\n",
    "      myEmptyArray = zeros([nRow, cCol], dtype=float)\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Input/Output\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Read .mat data\n",
    "In this course, data are provided by **.mat** files. You may use [`scipy.io.load()`] function to load **.mat** files. You can also use [`h5py`](https://www.h5py.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOU ARE NOT RECOMMEDED TO USE SUCH LONG FUNCTION NAME SUCH AS ```scipy.io.loadmat()```. A better way to do this is** \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import scipy.io as sio\n",
    "sio.loadmat()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover Each file may contain several data objects. If we load it in python, these data objects will be regarded as dictories, and each data object can be accessed using corresponding dictionary name. \n",
    "* Example: we have a data file *myDataFile.mat* which contains following data object (or dictionaries): *dic1*, *dic2*, ... Then\n",
    "```\n",
    "import scipy.sio as sio\n",
    "myDic1Data = sio.loadmat('myDataFile.mat')['dic1']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Read.csv\n",
    "You can use **csv** package to interact with *.csv* files. **csv** package is a standard package of python, you do not need install it by yourself. A basic structure for reading a csv file is described as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "with open('myCsv.csv', 'rb') as csvfile:\n",
    "    spamreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')\n",
    "    for row in spamreader:\n",
    "        # Remeber, python indices start from 0\n",
    "        print(row[0])\n",
    "        print(row[1])\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Read image\n",
    "You can use the [`scikit-image`](https://scikit-image.org/) for image processing. To read an image, you can used [`skimage.io.imread()`](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.io.html#skimage.io.imread):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from skimage.io import imread\n",
    "mPxl = imread('mImage.jpg')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4. Plotting\n",
    "[`matplot.pyplot`](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html) is a very effective plotting tool. It support single plot, and subplots. Code block below is an example to make subplots:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(15, 8))\n",
    "ax[0].imshow(some picture)\n",
    "ax[1].imshow(some picture)\n",
    "#fig.tight_layout()\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Numerical Computation\n",
    "[`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) is the main tool for array processing. Here we provide some example usages of several functions:\n",
    "* numpy.zeros([a, b, c]): create a zero array with the dimension of *a x b x c*\n",
    "* numpy.ones([a, b, c]): create an one array with the dimension of *a x b x c*\n",
    "* numpy.linspace(start, end, num): craete an array of *num* elements which are equally distributed in the interval between *start* and *end*\n",
    "* numpy.std(axis)/numpy.mean(axis): calculate the mean/std along a specific axis."
