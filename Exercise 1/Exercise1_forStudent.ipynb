    "The objective of the exercise is to build the facial expression recognition system. The system includes face preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. In the exercise, you will learn how to preprocess the facial expression image, extract the feature from an image or a video, and classify the video into one category.\n",

    "Specifically, the region of interest (i.e., facial image) is extracted using face tracking, face registration and face crop functions.  Basic spatiotemporal features (i.e., LBP-TOP features) are extracted using LBP-TOP. To produce emotion recognition case, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are trained.  50 videos from 5 participants are used to train the emotion recognition, use spatiotemporal features. The rest of the data (50 videos) is used to evaluate the performances of the trained recognition systems.\n"
